### Why do we need this website?
This basic site used for sellers in any store. The website provides users to create categories or products. Users can reduce or increase quantity of their products. It means if seller sells a product in the site the amount of product is also reducible or if employees brings new products or more products that already exists in store, they can add new product or put up quantity to their product. This is why i created the website.
